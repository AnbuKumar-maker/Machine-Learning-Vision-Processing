# Machine-Learning-Vision-Processing
This project is built upon vision processing and IoT. Google Cloud connected camera for all difference classification and detection. This project demonstrates building artificial intelligence (AI) based outdoor camera . Solution is built upon android things OS, Tensorflow and google cloud service, Firebase. Although, I used Raspberry Pi 3 for building this project, any hardware platform supporting Android Things could be used with having supported camera sensor and peripheral board, if required. This CCTV is remotely configurable using Firebase config and could OTA updated from Android Things Console.  Vision processing and Cloud upload is core of this project. Objective of this project is to build a camera device which could collect data and send those data to cloud for learning. Get update on the learning and then do further job based on those learning. Individual use case could easily be configured to the device over Firebase config interface and doesn't require OTA update for such tailoring.
